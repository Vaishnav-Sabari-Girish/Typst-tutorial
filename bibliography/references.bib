  abstract = {Climate change is leading to more and more extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall and flooding. This technical report deals with the question of how rescue commanders can be better and faster provided with current information during flood disasters using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e. during the flood in July 2021 in Central Europe, more specifically in Erftstadt / Blessem. The UAVs were used for live observation and regular inspections of the flood edge on the one hand, and on the other hand for the systematic data acquisition in order to calculate 3D models using Structure from Motion and MultiView Stereo. The 3D models embedded in a GIS application serve as a planning basis for the systematic exploration and decision support for the deployment of additional smaller UAVs but also rescue forces. The systematic data acquisition of the UAVs by means of autonomous meander flights provides high-resolution images which are computed to a georeferenced 3D model of the surrounding area within 15 minutes in a specially equipped robotic command vehicle (RobLW). From the comparison of high-resolution elevation profiles extracted from the 3D model on successive days, changes in the water level become visible. This information enables the emergency management to plan further inspections of the buildings and to search for missing persons on site.},

@article{Detecting_Human_Ahmad_2022,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Human action recognition and detection from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has emerged as a popular technical challenge in recent years, since it is related to many use case scenarios from environmental monitoring to search and rescue. It faces a number of difficulties mainly due to image acquisition and contents, and processing constraints. Since drones’ flying conditions constrain image acquisition, human subjects may appear in images at variable scales, orientations, and occlusion, which makes action recognition more difficult. We explore low-resource methods for ML (machine learning)-based action recognition using a previously collected real-world dataset (the \textquotedblleft Okutama-Action\textquotedblright  dataset). This dataset contains representative situations for action recognition, yet is controlled for image acquisition parameters such as camera angle or flight altitude. We investigate a combination of object recognition and classifier techniques to support single-image action identification. Our architecture integrates YoloV5 with a gradient boosting classifier; the rationale is to use a scalable and efficient object recognition system coupled with a classifier that is able to incorporate samples of variable difficulty. In an ablation study, we test different architectures of YoloV5 and evaluate the performance of our method on Okutama-Action dataset. Our approach outperformed previous architectures applied to the Okutama dataset, which differed by their object identification and classification pipeline: we hypothesize that this is a consequence of both YoloV5 performance and the overall adequacy of our pipeline to the specificities of the Okutama dataset in terms of bias\textendash variance tradeoff.</jats:p>},

@article{An_Unmanned_Aer_Alawad_2023,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Over the course of the last decade, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research community has received a significant amount of attention. Emergency response operations, such as those that follow a natural disaster, are one of the civil applications that could benefit from the use of UAVs in disaster and crisis management. In the event of a catastrophic event, it would be extremely beneficial for both victims and first responders to have access to a UAV network that is capable of deploying independently and offering communication services. However, when working with complicated situations, one of the most difficult things is coming up with exploratory paths for the networks involved. A crisis and disaster management system using a swarm optimization algorithm (SOA) is proposed to assist in disaster and crisis management. In this system, the UAV search and rescue team follows the strategy called the delay tolerant network, which has the ability to explore. The proposed approach is able to find the global maximum in the search space without ever settling for a suboptimal solution. This work has two primary objectives: the first is to investigate a potential disaster zone, and the second is to direct the UAV to a number of victim groups that were found during the investigation phase. For the purpose of performing a characterization, performance metrics such as delay, throughput, performance rate, and path loss have been analyzed. The results show the superiority of the performance over the existing work.</jats:p>},

@article{A_Systematic_Li_Habibi_2025,
  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), initially developed for military applications, are now used in various fields. As UAVs become more common across multiple industries, it is crucial to understand how to adopt them effectively, efficiently, and safely. The utilization of UAVs in healthcare and emergency services has evolved significantly in recent years, with these aerial vehicles potentially contributing to increased survival rates and enhanced healthcare services.   This paper presents a two-stage systematic literature review, including a tertiary study of 15 review papers and an in-depth assessment of 136 primary publications focused on using UAVs in healthcare and emergency services. The research demonstrates how civilian UAVs have been used in numerous applications, such as healthcare emergencies, medical supply delivery, and disaster management, for diverse use cases such as Automated External Defibrillator (AED) delivery, blood delivery, and search and rescue.   The studies indicate that UAVs significantly improve response times in emergency situations, enhance survival rates by ensuring the timely delivery of critical medical supplies such as AEDs, and prove to be cost-effective alternatives to traditional delivery methods, especially in remote or inaccessible areas. The studies also highlight the need for ongoing research and development to address existing challenges, such as regulatory frameworks, security, privacy and safety concerns, infrastructure development, and ethical and social issues. Effectively understanding and tackling these challenges is essential for maximizing the benefits of UAV technology in healthcare and emergency services, ultimately leading to safer, more resilient, and responsive systems that can better serve public health needs.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>When an emergency occurs, immediate responses are needed for the affected areas. Conventional means of transportation often face difficulties carrying supplies to the location in need, especially in severely damaged areas.In this project, a small semi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was designed and constructed to undertake a representative humanitarian aid mission. The system has a novel hex-rotor design with overlapping propellers. Half of the motors have been turned upside down with a slight overlap between each propeller, hence reducing the total dimension of the system without losing its efficiency. The system is also equipped with a new lightweight servo activated two ring release system, allowing it to carry and release two kilograms of payloads with only small physical force needed.Overall, the system is capable to operate automatically while performing a series of tasks such as navigate waypoints and deliver payloads before returning to base. the system created in this project could deliver two individual payloads of 1 kg each to the pre-destinated target almost autonomously. The system provided promising results that encourage the utilization of UAV for delivering Humanitarian Aid.</jats:p>},

We demonstrate the potential of this technique in identifying disasters with high accuracy, by means of a relatively simple deep learning model. Based on a dataset of 544 images (containing disaster images such as fires, earthquakes, collapsed buildings, tsunami and flooding, as well as non-disaster scenes), our results show an accuracy of 91\% achieved, indicating that deep learning, combined with UAV equipped with camera sensors, have the potential to predict disasters with high accuracy.},

@article{Drone_Secure_Co_Ko_Yo_2021,
  abstract = {<jats:p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) plays a paramount role in various fields, such as military, aerospace, reconnaissance, agriculture, and many more. The development and implementation of these devices have become vital in terms of usability and reachability. Unfortunately, as they become widespread and their demand grows, they are becoming more and more vulnerable to several security attacks, including, but not limited to, jamming, information leakage, and spoofing. In order to cope with such attacks and security threats, a proper design of robust security protocols is indispensable. Although several pieces of research have been carried out with this regard, there are still research gaps, particularly concerning UAV-to-UAV secure communication, support for perfect forward secrecy, and provision of non-repudiation. Especially in a military scenario, it is essential to solve these gaps. In this paper, we studied the security prerequisites of the UAV communication protocol, specifically in the military setting. More importantly, a security protocol (with two sub-protocols), that serves in securing the communication between UAVs, and between a UAV and a Ground Control Station, is proposed. This protocol, apart from the common security requirements, achieves perfect forward secrecy and non-repudiation, which are essential to a secure military communication. The proposed protocol is formally and thoroughly verified by using the BAN-logic (Burrow-Abadi-Needham logic) and Scyther tool, followed by performance evaluation and implementation of the protocol on a real UAV. From the security and performance evaluation, it is indicated that the proposed protocol is superior compared to other related protocols while meeting confidentiality, integrity, mutual authentication, non-repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, perfect backward secrecy, response to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, man-in-the-middle protection, and D2D (Drone-to-Drone) security.</jats:p>},
